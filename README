This project is basically an android application for drupal site.
We have used phonegap to compile the code onto native android platform.
Used Drupalgap for basic UI theme, and their API's for calls to drupal site.

my_module.js:
	Core logic implemeted by us.

drupalgap.js:
	This is default file that we get from drupalgap, which proves to be of great help.
